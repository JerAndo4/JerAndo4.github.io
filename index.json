Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on.\nWhat does it mean? The “markup language” is just a set of conventions, rules.\nLet’s say that you communicate with a friend by SMS. You can’t make the text bold or slanted in them. You agree with a friend: if I write * something* so between the asterisks, then consider it an oblique text. And if I write ** something ** between two asterisks, then consider it a bold text. You came up with the rules.\nMarkdown is a set of similar rules.\nWhy is this necessary?   To add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc.\n  For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.\n  Markdown syntax This is a quick reference of the basic elements of the Markdown syntax. There is no single standard and different versions of Markdown may differ in details. But the basic elements from the list below are supported in all standards.\nText Selection *This text will be slanted (italics) *\n_ This text will be slanted (italics) _\n** This text will be bold **\n__ This text will be bold __\n_ It is possible to ** insert ** one type into another _\nHeadings #This is the largest header, it turns into a \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag ##\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; ###\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; ####\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt; #####\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt; ######\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;  Links https://github.com — the text of a simple link will become a clickable link automatically\nAny text can be made a link:\nThis is a link to GitHub\nQuote  (\u0026gt;)This is a wise quote\n  (\u0026gt;)A wise man.\n Write without brackets!!!\nLists An unnumbered list:\n  Item (*)\n  One more point (*)\n  Sub-item (Tab + *)\n  One more sub-item (Tab + *)\n    Write without brackets and before paragraphs!!!\nFor sub-items, use TAB\nNumbered list:   Item\n  One more point\n  Sub-item\n  One more sub-item\n    For sub-items, use TAB\nYou can use any numbers in the numbered list — it doesn’t matter.

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to return later to a specific version. For file version control, this book will use the source code of the software as an example, although in fact you can use version control for almost any type of file.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and you want to save every version of an image or layout (most likely you will), the version control system (hereinafter referred to as SLE) — just what you need. It allows you to return files to the state they were in before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using SLE also means in general that if you have broken something or lost files, you can safely fix everything. In addition to everything, you will get it all without any extra effort.\n  Local version control systems\n  Many people use copying files to a separate directory as a version control method (perhaps even a directory with a time stamp, if they are smart enough). This approach is very common because of its simplicity, but it is incredibly prone to errors. You can easily forget which directory you are in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files that you wanted.\nIn order to solve this problem, programmers have long ago developed local SLE with a simple database that stores records of all changes in files, thereby monitoring revisions.\n   Figure 1. Local version control\nCentralized version control systems  The next major problem that people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (CSKA) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server containing all versions of files, and a number of clients that receive files from this centralized repository. The use of CSKA has been the standard for many years.\n   Figure 2. Centralized version control\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, all project developers know to a certain extent what each of them is doing. Administrators have full control over who can do what, and it is much easier to administer the CSCS than to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious disadvantage is a single point of failure represented by a centralized server. If this server goes down for an hour, then during this time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share these changes with other developers. If the hard disk on which the central database is stored is damaged, and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything — the entire history of the project, not counting single repository snapshots that have been saved on local developer machines. Local SLE suffer from the same problem: when the entire project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems  This is where distributed Version control systems (RSCs) come into play. In RSKV (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients do not just download a snapshot of all files (the state of files at a certain point in time) — they completely copy the repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers exchanged data dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\n   Figure 3. Distributed version control\nMoreover, many RSCs can simultaneously interact with several remote repositories, thanks to this you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several approaches to development at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\nWhat is Git?  What is Git, in short? It is very important to understand this part of the material, because if you understand what Git is and the basics of how it works, then it may be much easier for you to use it. While you are learning Git, try to forget everything you know about other SLE, such as Subversion and Perforce. This will allow you to avoid certain problems when using the tool. Git stores and uses information quite differently compared to other systems, even though the user interface is quite similar, and understanding these differences will help you avoid confusion during use.\nSnapshots, not differences\nThe main difference between Git and any other SLE (including Subversion and its brethren) — this is an approach to working with your data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of changes in files. These systems (CVS, Subversion, …","date":1651795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651795200,"objectID":"d46af64bf38b50aa89a796d79309a4b0","permalink":"https://example.com/post/version-control.-git./","publishdate":"2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control.-git./","section":"post","summary":"Today we will talk about Version Control and Git.","tags":["Version Control and Git."],"title":"Version control.
